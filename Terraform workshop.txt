Terraform looks only in the directory it runs.

Terraform state shows what happened the last time you ran Terraform.

Any changes made on console will be overwritten next time script is run.

Terraform script - source of truth.
Tfstate matches resource name with arn

Terraform script - today 
Tfstate - past

If something is in script, and in console, but not on tfstate -> update

Refer to a different resource -> class_name.instance_name.parameter

TF first establishes dependencies.

Organization - One for one

Terragrunt organizes TF files.

Module template and use source path.
